        <p class="lead">
        An alternative <code>git</code> management scheme.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>While developing WorldEdit after 7.1.0, we quickly ran into a problem where the non-finalized features on the
<code>master</code> branch prevented us from releasing very important bug-fixes that are also on <code>master</code>.
We should really have been able to put out a 7.1.1, 7.1.2, etc. to provide easier access to these small but
necessary fixes, such as UTF-8 for localization and biome math.</p>
<p>To alleviate this issue, I propose a new system of branch management for WorldEdit. This derives from
<a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Flow</a>.</p>
<h1>The New Management</h1>
<h2>Ideology</h2>
<p>The primary ideology of this new branch management system is to <strong>avoid being locked in to any version</strong>.
We should never delay bug-fixes because we have a feature in the same branch, and we should never postpone minor
features because we introduced breaking changes.</p>
<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>There are 6 types of branches:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>master</code> The main branch. It contains bug-fixes merged from <code>release</code>, and features merged from feature branches.</li>
<li><code>release</code> - The secondary branch. It contains tagged release commits, and then <em>only</em> bug-fixes. No feature
branches are merged (directly) into <code>release</code>.</li>
<li><code>version/M.m.P</code> - A temporary version branch that contains the bug-fixes being prepared for the next <code>release</code>.</li>
<li><code>bugfix/*</code> - Bug-fix branches. These are optional, but should be used for larger bug-fixes or things which need
approval. They are targeted to the <code>version/M.m.P</code> branch, not the <code>master</code> or <code>release</code> branches.</li>
<li><code>feature/*</code> - Feature branches. These are non-optional. They are targeted to the <code>master</code> branch, not the
<code>release</code> branch.</li>
<li>Any other branch (such as one for GitHub issue templates, or README updates) should target <code>master</code>, as it is the
<em>main</em> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this model, we can continue to release bug-fixes while still adding new features without much hassle.</p>
<h3>Published Branches</h3>
<p>Only two branches are published to Maven, <code>master</code> and <code>release</code>. Even though the bug-fixes go into a
<code>version/M.m.P</code> branch, since they are also included in <code>master</code> there is no need to push a release to maven
including these fixes. If a developer needs them for work, they should use <code>master</code>, or wait for a fresh
<code>release</code>.</p>
<h2>Day-to-Day</h2>
<p>If you've got a new bug-fix, it goes in the current <code>version/M.m.P</code> branch, or a new <code>bugfix/*</code> branch targeting the
version branch. If you've got a new feature, make a <code>feature/*</code> branch and PR it to <code>master</code>.</p>
<p>Besides the new rule for bug-fixes, not much changes here. If you need a bug-fix from a <code>version/M.m.P</code> branch, it may
be merged into <code>master</code> at any time for the price of one merge commit. Generally this shouldn't be needed, as big
bug-fixes will warrant triggering the <em>Patch Version Release Process</em> described below, which also merges the version
branch into <code>master</code>.</p>
<p>Any breaking changes should be avoided at all costs. If it is necessary to introduce breaking changes, or something has
been deprecated for over 6 months, a major version release may be triggered, but the actual breaking changes should
remain in a <code>feature/*</code> branch until we are ready to cut the release. Under no circumstances should a breaking change
remain in <code>master</code> for more than 24 hours without a major version release following it.</p>
<h2>Release Process</h2>
<h3>Major/Minor Version</h3>
<p>Assuming we are currently working on <code>7.1.P-SNAPSHOT</code> / <code>7.2.0-SNAPSHOT</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>If present, any <code>version/7.1.P</code> branches are merged into <code>master</code> and removed.</li>
<li><code>master</code> is merged into <code>release</code>.</li>
<li>A commit is made to <code>release</code> changing the version to <code>7.2.0</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>version/7.2.1</code> branch is made from the tip of <code>release</code>.</li>
<li>A commit is made to <code>version/7.2.1</code> changing its version to <code>7.2.1-SNAPSHOT</code></li>
<li>A commit is made to <code>master</code> changing its version to <code>7.3.0-SNAPSHOT</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is the same for a major version, except that the version number changes in the major part for releasing.</p>
<h3>Patch Version</h3>
<p>Assuming we are currently working on <code>7.2.P-SNAPSHOT</code> / <code>7.3.0-SNAPSHOT</code> (<code>Q</code> is the next patch version):</p>
<ol>
<li><code>version/7.2.P</code> is merged into <code>release</code> and <code>master</code>, then removed.</li>
<li>A commit is made to <code>release</code> changing the version to <code>7.2.P</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>version/7.2.Q</code> branch is made from the tip of <code>release</code>.</li>
<li>A commit is made to <code>version/7.2.Q</code> changing its version to <code>7.2.Q-SNAPSHOT</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Important Note about Merging Version Branches</h3>
<p>One important part of merging any <code>version/M.m.P</code> branch into <code>master</code>, is that care must be taken not to overwrite
<code>master</code>'s version with the version branch's version. This should result in a merge-conflict normally, just be sure to
pick <code>master</code> as the winner of the conflict in this case.</p>
<h2>EAQ (Expected-to-be Asked Questions)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Won't merging <code>version/M.m.P</code> into <code>master</code> create a lot of merge commits?
<ul>
<li>Yes, but it is worth not being able to release crucial fixes to end users. If you have a better proposal on how we
could accomplish this, please write it up and present it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(That's all the questions I expected!)</p>
